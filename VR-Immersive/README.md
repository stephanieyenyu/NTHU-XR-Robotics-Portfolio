## Overview
An immersive Virtual Reality experience developed using the **XR Interaction Toolkit**. The project focuses on realistic physics-based interactions to enhance user presence and hand-eye coordination in a virtual space.

## Technical Implementation
* **Physics-Based Interaction:** Configured `XRGrabInteractable` components to allow natural grabbing, throwing, and manipulation of 3D objects with weight and momentum.

* **Locomotion System:** Implemented a hybrid movement system combining Teleportation (for comfort) and Continuous Move (for immersion), ensuring a nause-free experience.

* **Hand Presence & Animation:** Integrated hand tracking visuals that dynamically react to controller inputs (grip/trigger) to simulate realistic hand gestures.

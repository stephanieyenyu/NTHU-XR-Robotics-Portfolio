## Overview
A 3D action game project demonstrating core game development principles. The goal was to build a robust character controller and manage complex game states without relying on pre-made assets for logic.

## Technical Implementation
* **Character Controller:** Designed a responsive player movement system that handles inputs, jumping physics, and collision detection against environmental obstacles.

* **Game State Management:** Built a central manager to handle game loops, including scoring logic, win/loss conditions, and UI scene transitions.

* **Physics Triggers & Events:** Utilized Unity's physics engine (`OnCollisionEnter`, `OnTriggerEnter`) to drive gameplay events such as collecting items or triggering traps.
